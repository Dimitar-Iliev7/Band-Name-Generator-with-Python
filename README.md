# Band-Name-Generator-with-Python
This is a Python program that generates a random band name. It asks the user for input and combines the input with random words to create a unique band name.

# Getting Started
To run the program, you will need to have Python installed on your computer. You can download the latest version of Python here.

You will also need to download the random module, which is a built-in module in Python. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal:

Once you have installed Python and the random module, you can download the band_name_generator.py file from this repository and run it in your Python environment.

# How to Use
When you run the program, it will ask you for two inputs:

The name of the city where you were born
The name of your favorite animal
After you enter these inputs, the program will generate a random band name based on your inputs. The band name will be a combination of your inputs and random words.

For example, if you enter "New York" and "Elephant", the program might generate the band name "New York Elephants of Chaos".
